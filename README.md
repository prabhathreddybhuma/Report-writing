## Abstract
This research presents an integrated framework that leverages advanced ML and DL methodologies—including supervised, unsupervised, and ensemble approaches—to detect, classify, and respond to a broad spectrum of cyber threats across large-scale network environments. The proposed system combines predictive analytics, automated anomaly detection, and explainable AI (XAI) to deliver transparent, actionable insights for security practitioners.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid ML-DL Models**: Combines supervised, unsupervised, and ensemble learning approaches
- **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving distributed training without raw data exposure
- **Explainable AI**: Transparent model decisions for security analysts
- **Real-time Detection**: Low-latency threat identification and response
- **Multi-dataset Support**: NSL-KDD, TON_IoT, and CICIDS2017 datasets
- **Adversarial Robustness**: Protection against ML evasion attacks
- **Protocol-aware Security**: Dynamic adaptation to evolving threats
